  "body": "This is a story of a star born, rising to the skies, burning bright and returning to regular life just in time to live his life like so many of us: married with children. The journey will take us through beautiful sceneries and legendary secrecies of not one, but two, World Heritage Sites.\r\n\r\nNot forgetting good food, drinks, sauna and generally having fun together, of course.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Prelude - The Facts\r\n\r\n* The bachelor party will be an overnight happening starting Saturday morning 10.9. and ending Sunday afternoon-ish 11.9.\r\n* The estimated cost is about 200 euros, including food, drinks, transportation and a night at a fancy boutique hotel in a shared room.\r\n* The party starts and ends in Helsinki.\r\n* We have a minivan and a couple of sedans with appointed drivers (chosen among the best of us) to haul everyone from one place to the other.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Part I - The Star Is Born\r\n\r\nUnaware of his upcoming visit to the ultimate heights of underground popularity, we'll pick up our star from his home to be blind transported against his will and better judgement to our first World Heritage Site, Suomenlinna.\r\n\r\n_This part will be handled by the organising crew._\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Part II - The Formative Years\r\n\r\n9:30. Aapo arrives at the synthesiser heaven known as [Suomenlinnan Studio](http://www.suomenlinnanstudio.fi/#tilat), where he gets to compose his masterpiece, to be performed at his upcoming penultimate gig. And, hopefully, at the wedding party.\r\n\r\n_The rest of the party should be at Suomenlinna Studio at 9:30 to welcome Aapo. Excluding a small group of volunteers that will smuggle picnic food and drinks to Suomenlinna. The picnic should be ready and waiting for the studio crew.\r\n\r\nAfter you arrive at the Studio, everything has already been planned out, so you can generally stop worrying at this point; just enjoy the ride and the good company you're taking it with._\r\n\r\n12:00. After a productive session with some of the finest music-making equipment man has ever built, it's time to cool down for a picnic at the picturesque environment of Suomenlinna.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Part Three - Transformation\r\n\r\n14:00. Replenished and full of vigour, the party starts is travel towards the next phase of the path to stardom. Life on the road is tough, but fortunately no one has to endure it alone.\r\n\r\n_We'll leave the Suomenlinna together with the ferry, save for the appointed drivers who have picked up the cars and are waiting for the party in a convenient location near Kauppatori._\r\n\r\n16:30. Being a rising star is sometimes easy: [the Hotel](http://www.wardshus.fi/en/hotel) is as sweet as an ARP 2600 bassline, and the beds as smooth as Moog triangle wave oscillators. But did someone forget to roll out the red carpet?\r\n\r\n_We arrive at Fiskars and check in at the hotel. You can leave your stuff there, everything is within walking distance._\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Part Four - Rising High\r\n\r\n17:30. This being famous thing stars to really pick up. There's [free drinks for everyone](http://www.rekolanpanimo.fi/in-english/), and a sauna, and a top-notch three-course dinner. On top of everything the whole entourage seems to be invited to everywhere also.\r\n\r\n_Beer tasting at Rekolan Panimo distillery, followed by sauna at WÃ¤rdshus, and dinner back at the distillery._\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Part Five - The Legend Leaves His Legacy\r\n\r\nLater. The star rises up to the challenge and gets up on the limelight. The music is loud, the beat is tight, resonant filters wail and 808s hammer grooves like a band of crazy blacksmiths.\r\n\r\n_We'll arrange a DJ gig in a local bar for Aapo with his previously arranged masterpiece and a selection of his grooves from the years. Find the selection at [Mikseri](http://www.mikseri.net/user/gebo+modyo) and pick out your favourites._\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Part Six - The Aftermath\r\n\r\nNext morning. The star and his entourage wake up in their hotel rooms with no recollection of ever getting out of the night club. The previous day's celebration seems but a distant memory now. As the morning sun hits hard on the weary eyes, the party drags themselves to the exquisite breakfast serving, preparing their long journey back to real life.\r\n\r\n_Breakfast at the hotel, transportation back to Helsinki and [goodbyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTstBMkeAH8)._",
